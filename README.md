This is my notebook using [Daily covid-19 Time-Series by Country Dataset](https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-time-series-19-covid-combined) from January to October 2020. 
The task was to :

(1) Compute principal components (with individual dates as original features).

(2) See how the top few components alone (from the original 265 features) can effectively reconstruct the original data.


It was also interesting to observe the plotted trends of different countries around the world for the last 10 months.
